🩺 LifeTrack – Patient-Centered Health Record Platform

LifeTrack is a health-focused Android application designed to give patients ownership and control of their medical records. Built with modern Android technologies, it bridges the gap between hospitals, clinics, and patients by providing a unified and portable digital health record system.

LifeTrack empowers users to connect with medical practitioners, access their health history, and manage their wellness journey—all in one place.

🚀 Overview

While most hospitals use EMR/EHR systems that store data within their walls, LifeTrack shifts the model toward patient-owned records.
Hospitals contribute verified data to a patient’s profile instead of holding exclusive control, enabling continuity of care across multiple facilities.
