## 🌍 About the Project

**LifeTrack** is a health-focused Android application designed to give patients **ownership and control of their medical records**.  
Built with modern Android technologies, it bridges the gap between hospitals, clinics, and patients by providing a **unified and portable digital health record system**.

LifeTrack empowers users to connect with medical practitioners, access their health history, and manage their wellness journey—all in one place.

## 🚀 Overview

While most hospitals use EMR/EHR systems that store data **within their walls**, LifeTrack shifts the model toward **patient-owned records**.  
Hospitals contribute verified data to a patient’s profile instead of holding exclusive control, enabling **continuity of care** across multiple facilities.



🖼️ **Available Screens:**
- Splash & Login  
- Patient Dashboard  
- Doctor Dashboard  
- Patient Records  
- Doctor’s Patient List

## 🧩 Key Features

✨ **Core Highlights:**
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication:** Patients and doctors log in safely using modern authentication protocols.  
- 🧠 **Patient-Owned Records:** Data travels with the patient, not locked to a single hospital.  
- 🏥 **Cross-Facility Continuity:** Health data can be shared across hospitals, ensuring uninterrupted care.  
- 🚑 **Emergency Access Layer:** QR/ID card access for emergency responders (allergies, conditions, blood type).  
- 📊 **Audit Trails:** Patients can view who accessed their records and when, promoting transparency.  
- 🌍 **Offline Access:** Critical information stored locally for emergencies.
