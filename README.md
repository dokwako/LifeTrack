  <i>Empowering patients to own their medical records and connect with healthcare providers seamlessly.</i>

## 🌍 About the Project

**LifeTrack** is a health-focused Android application designed to give patients **ownership and control of their medical records**.  
Built with modern Android technologies, it bridges the gap between hospitals, clinics, and patients by providing a **unified and portable digital health record system**.

LifeTrack empowers users to connect with medical practitioners, access their health history, and manage their wellness journey—all in one place.

---

## 🚀 Overview

While most hospitals use EMR/EHR systems that store data **within their walls**, LifeTrack shifts the model toward **patient-owned records**.  
Hospitals contribute verified data to a patient’s profile instead of holding exclusive control, enabling **continuity of care** across multiple facilities.
